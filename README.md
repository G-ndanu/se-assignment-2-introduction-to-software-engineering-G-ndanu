Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is a discipline that involves the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engineering is a discipline that involves the application of engineering principles in a systematic manner to the development, operation and maintenance of software systems, thus emphasizing quality assurance, collaboration and long-term sustainability. In contrast to software engineering, traditional programming involves the art of writing code to address specific requirements without comprehensive planning, design, or consideration of broader software engineering principles. 


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
The Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) is composed of six phases namely:
1. Requirements
This phase involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

2. Design
This phase involves creating high-level detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.

3. Implementation
This phase involves writing code and building software according to the design specifications.

4. Testing
This phase involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

5. Deployment
This phase involves releasing the software to users and customers for use.

6. Maintenance
This phase invloves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
The Waterfall model is a sequential approach to software development characterized by distinct phases, while the Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach towards software development. 
The key differences between Agile and Waterfall models include:
1. Approach
The Agile model follows an incremental and iterative approach that allows adaptability and provides room for continuous improvement, in contrast to the waterfall model where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. 

2. Flexibility
Agile is highly flexible thus adaptable to changing requirements throughout the project, while the waterfall model is less flexible, making it challenging to accommodate changes once a phase is completed. 

Agile model is most preferred for long-term projects due to its flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements, while the Waterfall model is most preferred for short-term projects due to its sequential nature, suitable for projects with well-defined requirements. 


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is a discipline that involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, validating and managing the needs and constraints of a software project.

The process of requirements engineering begins with a feasibility study to assess the viability of the proposed software project. This involves analyzing factors such as technical feasibility, economic viability and organizational readiness to determine if the project is worth pursuing. Once this phase is done, the requirements elicitation phase follows. This phase involves engaging with stakeholders to gather their requirements, expectations and constraints regarding the software system through techniques such as interviews and surveys. The requirements specification phase follows right after, and it involves documenting both the functional and non-functional requirements gathered in a clear and unambigous manner. Once the requirements are documented, the requirements validation and verification phase begins. The verification process involves checking that the requirements are complete, consistent and accurate while the validation process involves checking that the requirements meet the needs and expectations of the stakeholders. The final step is requirements management, which involves tracking changes, assessing their impact on the project, ensuring that the software remains aligned with stakeholders' goals and that it is developed on time, within budget and to the required quality.

Requirements engineering is important in the SDLC, as it:
- helps ensure that the software system meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders, thereby increasing its chances of success in the market.
- helps identify potential issues or problems early in the development process so that potential risks and uncertainties can be addressed proactively, reducing the likelihood of project failures.
- improves communication and collaboration between the development team and stakeholders, reducing misunderstandings and conflicts.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design is the process of creating software modules. It involves the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, independent, and interchangeable modules. 

It contributes to the maintainability and scalability of software systems by: 
- defining modules with clear interfaces, thus enabling code to be reused across different parts of the system, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency.
- allowing for individual modules to be tested independently, streamlining the testing process.
- allowing different developers to work on separate modules concurrently, speeding up development and enhancing scalability.
- making it easier to accomodate new features or changes without interfering with the entire codebase. 


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit Testing
It is the process of testing individual components or modules of software. 

2. Integration Testing
It is the process of testing interactions between different components or subsystems. 

3. System Testing
It is the process of testing the entire software as a whole.

4. Acceptance Testing
It is the process of testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. 

They are important in software development as they:
- facilitate collaboration among developers.
- provide a backup for the software project being worked on.
- allow tracking of who made changes, what changes were made, and why they were made.
- support branching, which enables developers to diverge from the main code line and continue working without affecting the mainline and merging, which integrates these changes back into the main code.
- facilitate code review processes by maintaining a detailed history of changes.

Popular version control systems: 
1. Git
Features: Distributed VCS, supports branching and merging, lightweight, fast, strong support for non-linear development, robust against corruption, handles large projects efficiently.

2. Subversion(SVN)
Features: Centralized VCS, versioning for directories and files, atomic commits, file locking, detailed history and metadata.

3. Mercurial
Features: Distributed VCS, easy to learn, robust performance, scalable, handles large projects well, strong branching and merging support.

4. Perforce
Features: Centralized VCS, high performance, excellent for large-scale development, strong support for binary files, file and branch-level access controls, automated build processes.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects:
1. Changing requirements
A change in project requirements often leads to scope creep, requiring adjustments in resources and timelines. This can strain project budgets and timelines while posing challenges in maintaining consistent quality throughout changes.

2. Tight deadlines
Narrow timeframes demand efficient task prioritization and resource management. Tight deadlines can stress team members and lead to compromises between speed and quality, especially when resources are limited.

3. Technical debt
Accumulated technical debt, resulting from shortcuts and quick fixes, can limit future development and increase maintenance expenses. Despite its long-term impact, stakeholders may not always prioritize addressing this issue immediately.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is process of changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs.

Types of maintenance activities
1. Corrective Maintenance
